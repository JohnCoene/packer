Description:
  Enforces good practice and provides convenience functions to make work with 'JavaScript' 
  not just easier but also scalable. It is a robust wrapper to 'NPM', 'yarn', and 'webpack' that 
  enables to compartmentalize 'JavaScript' code, leverage 'NPM' and 'yarn' packages, include
  'TypeScript', 'React', or 'Vue' in web applications, and much more.
